# Rogue Basin Reconstructions Analysis Project
 The repository for the Rogue Basin Reconstructions analysis. This contains the R scripts for reading in the data, running the Bayesian models for age, equations for back-aging dead wood, reconstructing basal area, stem density, and assessing number of individual and clumps in historical stands.

## Parts 1 - 6 R scripts
Run these R scripts to format the data and then run them through the analysis stages.

## "Archive" folder
Old and or duplicate files

## "Basalradiusfiles" folder
All the reconstructed radii for trees given the species-site chronology

## "Chronologies" folder
The chronologies for all crossdated cores

## "ChurchillCalculations" folder
Folder containing all the Churchill ICO calculations (not yet being utilized for analysis)
