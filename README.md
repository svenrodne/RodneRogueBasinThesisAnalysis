# Rodne Rogue Basin Thesis Analysis
Created by Sven Rodne

Here lies the required code to dive into the Rogue Basin site data for my 2025 Thesis: "100 Years of Change in Forest Structure, Composition, and Spatial Patterning in Southwest Oregon’s Rogue Basin". This thesis can be found in OSU's scholar archive (add link here)

This code and the data process can serve as a template for others to "ungrow" a forest back in time. There were several liberties taken in some places (i.e. decay rate of dead wood, resprouting ability of hardwoods, etc.) that helped me carry along this data to my results. Every step of this modeling process can and should be updated and made to be more efficient, robust, and eventually more accurate.

If you find this code helpful or amusing, feel free to send me a "how do you do" at: skrodne@gmail.com

# Data structure
The significant part of this code rests within the KNN step markdown files. Unless updates to R, R Studio, and associated packages update at a faster rate than I come back and clean the code up from time to time, it should run right through to the results markdowns. If it doesn't, drop me an email and I can try to sift through what went wrong. I'm a frequent flyer in the realm of "Uh-oh, why didn't that work, it should've worked, please work..." 

The folders contain chronologies from tree cores taken for the project, origin data files (which are cleaned in the first couple of steps),
