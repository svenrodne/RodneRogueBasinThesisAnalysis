# Rodne Rogue Basin Thesis Analysis
# Created by Sven Rodne

# Here lies the required code to dive into the Rogue Basin site data for my 2025 Thesis: "100 Years of Change in Forest Structure, Composition, and Spatial Patterning in Southwest Oregon’s Rogue Basin". This thesis can be found in OSU's scholar archive (add link here)

# This code and the data process can serve as a template for others to "ungrow" a forest back in time. There were several liberties taken in some places (i.e. decay rate of dead wood, resprouting ability of hardwoods, etc.) that helped me carry along this data to my results. Every step of this modeling process can and should be updated and made to be more efficient, robust, and eventually more accurate.

# If you find this code helpful or amusing, feel free to send me a "how do you do" at: skrodne@gmail.com
